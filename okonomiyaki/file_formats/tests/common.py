Description: The Enstaller (version 4) project is a managing and install tool
        for egg-based Python distributions.
        
        Enstaller consists of the sub-packages enstaller (package managing
        tool) and egginst (package (un)install tool).  We find the clean
        separation into these two tasks, each of which having a well-defined
        scope, extremely useful.
        
        
        enstaller:
        ----------
        
        enstaller is a managing tool for egginst-based installs, and the CLI is
        called enpkg which calls out to egginst to do the actual install.
        enpkg can access distributions from local and HTTP repositories, which
        are pre-indexed.  The point of the index file (index-depend.bz2) is that
        enpkg can download this file at the beginning of an install session
        and resolve dependencies prior to downloading the actual files.
        
        
        egginst:
        --------
        
        egginst is the underlying tool for installing and uninstalling eggs.
        The tool is brain dead in the sense that it does not care if the eggs
        it installs are for the correct platform, it's dependencies got installed,
        another package needs to be uninstalled prior to the install, and so on.
        Those tasks are responsibilities of a package manager, and are outside
        the scope of egginst.
        
        egginst installs modules and packages directly into site-packages, i.e.
        no .egg directories are created, hence there is no extra .pth-file which
        results in a sorter python path and faster import times (which seems to
        have the biggest advantage for namespace packages).  egginst knows about
        the eggs the people from Enthought use.  It can install shared libraries,
        change binary headers, etc., things which would require special post install
        scripts if easy_install installs them.
        
        
        The egg format:
        ---------------
        
        The Enstaller egg format deals with two aspects: the actual install (egginst),
        and the distribution management (enpkg).  As far as egginst is concerned,
        the format is an extension of the setuptools egg format, i.e. all archive
        files, except the ones starting with 'EGG-INFO/' are installed into the
        site-packages directory.  In fact, since egginst a brain dead low-level tool,
        it will even install an egg without an 'EGG-INFO' directory.  But more
        importantly, egginst installs ordinary setuptools just fine.  Within the
        'EGG-INFO/' namespace are special archives which egginst is looking for to
        install files, as well as symbolic links, into locations other than
        site-packages, and post install (and pre uninstall) scripts it can run.
        
        As far as enpkg is concerned, eggs should contain a meta-data file with the
        archive name 'EGG-INFO/spec/depend'.  The the index file (index-depend.bz2)
        is essentially a compressed concatenation of the 'EGG-INFO/spec/depend' files
        for all eggs in a directory/repository.
        
        
        Egg file name format:
        ---------------------
        
        Eggs follow the following naming convention::
        
           <name>-<version>-<build>.egg
        
        ``<name>``
           The package name, which may contain the following characters:
           Letters (both lower or uppercase), digits, underscore '_' and a dot '.'
        
        ``<version>``
           The version number, which is restricted to containing the
           same characters as the package name, and which should
           follow `PEP 386 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0386/>`_.
        
        ``<build>``
           The build number, which may only contains digits (with no leading zeros).
           This number is used to distinguish between different eggs which were build
           from the same project source.  Having different build numbers becomes
           necessary when, for example: eggs are build for different Python versions,
           a build bug is fixed, a patch is applied to the source, etc. .
        
        The regular expression for a valid egg file name is::
        
           r'([\w.]+)-([\w.]+)-(\d+)\.egg$'
        
        
        The metadata format:
        --------------------
        
        Build numbers are a way to differentiate eggs which have the have the
        same name and version, but different dependencies.  The platform and
        architecture dependencies of a distributions (or egg) is most easily
        differentiated by putting them into different directories.  This leaves
        us with the Python dependency and other egg dependencies to put into the
        build number.  A dependencies specification data file is contained inside
        the egg itself, that is in the archive ``EGG-INFO/spec/depend``, and the
        md5sum and filesize is prepended to the data when the index-depend.bz2 is
        created.
        
        
        Installation:
        -------------
        
        The preferred and easiest way to install Enstaller from the executable egg,
        e.i. the Enstaller egg contains a bash header, and on Unix system, you can
        also download the egg and type::
        
           $ bash enstaller-4.5.0-1.egg
           Bootstrapping: ...
           283 KB [.................................................................]

        as Enstaller is the install tool for the Enthought Python Distribution (EPD),
        all EPD installers already include Enstaller.

PKG_INFO_ENSTALLER_1_0_DESCRIPTION = u"""\
The Enstaller (version 4) project is a managing and install tool
for egg-based Python distributions.

Enstaller consists of the sub-packages enstaller (package managing
tool) and egginst (package (un)install tool).  We find the clean
separation into these two tasks, each of which having a well-defined
scope, extremely useful.


enstaller:
----------

enstaller is a managing tool for egginst-based installs, and the CLI is
called enpkg which calls out to egginst to do the actual install.
enpkg can access distributions from local and HTTP repositories, which
are pre-indexed.  The point of the index file (index-depend.bz2) is that
enpkg can download this file at the beginning of an install session
and resolve dependencies prior to downloading the actual files.


egginst:
--------

egginst is the underlying tool for installing and uninstalling eggs.
The tool is brain dead in the sense that it does not care if the eggs
it installs are for the correct platform, it's dependencies got installed,
another package needs to be uninstalled prior to the install, and so on.
Those tasks are responsibilities of a package manager, and are outside
the scope of egginst.

egginst installs modules and packages directly into site-packages, i.e.
no .egg directories are created, hence there is no extra .pth-file which
results in a sorter python path and faster import times (which seems to
have the biggest advantage for namespace packages).  egginst knows about
the eggs the people from Enthought use.  It can install shared libraries,
change binary headers, etc., things which would require special post install
scripts if easy_install installs them.


The egg format:
---------------

The Enstaller egg format deals with two aspects: the actual install (egginst),
and the distribution management (enpkg).  As far as egginst is concerned,
the format is an extension of the setuptools egg format, i.e. all archive
files, except the ones starting with 'EGG-INFO/' are installed into the
site-packages directory.  In fact, since egginst a brain dead low-level tool,
it will even install an egg without an 'EGG-INFO' directory.  But more
importantly, egginst installs ordinary setuptools just fine.  Within the
'EGG-INFO/' namespace are special archives which egginst is looking for to

site-packages, and post install (and pre uninstall) scripts it can run.

As far as enpkg is concerned, eggs should contain a meta-data file with the
archive name 'EGG-INFO/spec/depend'.  The the index file (index-depend.bz2)
is essentially a compressed concatenation of the 'EGG-INFO/spec/depend' files
for all eggs in a directory/repository.


Egg file name format:
---------------------

Eggs follow the following naming convention::

   <name>-<version>-<build>.egg

``<name>``
   The package name, which may contain the following characters:
   Letters (both lower or uppercase), digits, underscore '_' and a dot '.'

``<version>``
   The version number, which is restricted to containing the
   same characters as the package name, and which should
   follow `PEP 386 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0386/>`_.

``<build>``
   The build number, which may only contains digits (with no leading zeros).
   This number is used to distinguish between different eggs which were build
   from the same project source.  Having different build numbers becomes
   necessary when, for example: eggs are build for different Python versions,
   a build bug is fixed, a patch is applied to the source, etc. .

The regular expression for a valid egg file name is::

   r'([\w.]+)-([\w.]+)-(\d+)\.egg$'


The metadata format:
--------------------

Build numbers are a way to differentiate eggs which have the have the
same name and version, but different dependencies.  The platform and
architecture dependencies of a distributions (or egg) is most easily
differentiated by putting them into different directories.  This leaves
us with the Python dependency and other egg dependencies to put into the

the egg itself, that is in the archive ``EGG-INFO/spec/depend``, and the
md5sum and filesize is prepended to the data when the index-depend.bz2 is
created.

About PySide
============

PySide is the Nokia-sponsored Python Qt bindings project, providing access to
not only the complete Qt 4.7 framework but also Qt Mobility, as well as to
generator tools for rapidly generating bindings for any C++ libraries.

The PySide project is developed in the open, with all facilities you’d expect
from any modern OSS project such as all code in a git repository [1], an open
Bugzilla [2] for reporting bugs, and an open design process [3]. We welcome
any contribution without requiring a transfer of copyright.

.. contents::

.. Medialog Boardfile
   -----
    
- Content type for uploading of documents that needs to be approved by many persons.
- The workflow is called "Multiapprove workflow"
- After installing you can set the group that can approve in /portal_workflow (default to "Reviewers")
- Reviewer is also added to portal_catalog index, so it is possible to make a smart folder showing only objects the current user has not approved
- Content that nobody has looked at for a certain time automatically gets published if nobody has "rejected" it.
- You will have to add clockserver after [instance] in your buildout, something like: 

zope-conf-additional =

<clock-server>
    method /mysite/@@tick
    period 120
    host localhost
    user admin
    password mypassword

</clock-server>

Please note, this product is still in the making

Changelog
=========

1.6 (2010-06-06)
----------------
- Changed Delivareable field to Float

1.1 (2010-06-06)
----------------
- Automatic publishing now happens n days after submit, in case a document is rejected and then submitted again.
- Validator for year (2010-2050)

1.0 (2010-06-06)
----------------

- Alfa version
- Created recipe with ZopeSkel
- Added content type "Boardfile"
- Added browser views
- Added workflow "multiapprove workflow" so all "Reviewers" can "approve" or "reject" the boardfile
- Added time based trasaction... the "Boardfile" gets published after "n" days if none of the "Reviewers" has "rejected" it.
- Added "Boardfile-listing" view. 
  Warning: This will give you an error if you use it on a folder containing something else than "Boardfiles", so it is in "skins" dir and not in ues.

To do: 
=======
- Change time to "creation date", it should take 20 days from creation, not from "last transaction in history".
- Far to much code in "browser"... could need some help here.
- Time before the transaction is now about 14 minutes (for testing), will change to 20 days.

Detailed Documentation
**********************

Introduction
============

This is a full-blown functional test. The emphasis here is on testing what
the user may input and see, and the system is largely tested as a black box.
We use PloneTestCase to set up this test as well, so we have a full Plone site
to play with. We *can* inspect the state of the portal, e.g. using 
self.portal and self.folder, but it is often frowned upon since you are not
treating the system as a black box. Also, if you, for example, log in or set
roles using calls like self.setRoles(), these are not reflected in the test
browser, which runs as a separate session.

Being a doctest, we can tell a story here.

First, we must perform some setup. We use the testbrowser that is shipped
with Five, as this provides proper Zope 2 integration. Most of the 
documentation, though, is in the underlying zope.testbrower package.

    >>> from Products.Five.testbrowser import Browser
    >>> browser = Browser()
    >>> portal_url = self.portal.absolute_url()

The following is useful when writing and debugging testbrowser tests. It lets
us see all error messages in the error_log.

    >>> self.portal.error_log._ignored_exceptions = ()

With that in place, we can go to the portal front page and log in. We will
do this using the default user from PloneTestCase:

    >>> from Products.PloneTestCase.setup import portal_owner, default_password

    >>> browser.open(portal_url)

We have the login portlet, so let's use that.

    >>> browser.getControl(name='__ac_name').value = portal_owner
    >>> browser.getControl(name='__ac_password').value = default_password
    >>> browser.getControl(name='submit').click()

Here, we set the value of the fields on the login form and then simulate a
submit click.

We then test that we are still on the portal front page:

    >>> browser.url == portal_url
    True

And we ensure that we get the friendly logged-in message:

    >>> "You are now logged in" in browser.contents
    True


-*- extra stuff goes here -*-
The Publication content type
===============================

In this section we are tesing the Publication content type by performing
basic operations like adding, updadating and deleting Publication content
items.

Adding a new Publication content item
--------------------------------

We use the 'Add new' menu to add a new content item.

    >>> browser.getLink('Add new').click()

Then we select the type of item we want to add. In this case we select
'Publication' and click the 'Add' button to get to the add form.

    >>> browser.getControl('Publication').click()
    >>> browser.getControl(name='form.button.Add').click()
    >>> 'Publication' in browser.contents
    True

Now we fill the form and submit it.

    >>> browser.getControl(name='title').value = 'Publication Sample'
    >>> browser.getControl('Save').click()
    >>> 'Changes saved' in browser.contents
    True

And we are done! We added a new 'Publication' content item to the portal.

Updating an existing Publication content item
---------------------------------------

Let's click on the 'edit' tab and update the object attribute values.

    >>> browser.getLink('Edit').click()
    >>> browser.getControl(name='title').value = 'New Publication Sample'
    >>> browser.getControl('Save').click()

We check that the changes were applied.

    >>> 'Changes saved' in browser.contents
    True
    >>> 'New Publication Sample' in browser.contents
    True

Removing a/an Publication content item
--------------------------------

If we go to the home page, we can see a tab with the 'New Publication
Sample' title in the global navigation tabs.

    >>> browser.open(portal_url)
    >>> 'New Publication Sample' in browser.contents
    True

Now we are going to delete the 'New Publication Sample' object. First we
go to the contents tab and select the 'New Publication Sample' for
deletion.

    >>> browser.getLink('Contents').click()
    >>> browser.getControl('New Publication Sample').click()

We click on the 'Delete' button.

    >>> browser.getControl('Delete').click()
    >>> 'Item(s) deleted' in browser.contents
    True

So, if we go back to the home page, there is no longer a 'New Publication
Sample' tab.

    >>> browser.open(portal_url)
    >>> 'New Publication Sample' in browser.contents
    False

Adding a new Publication content item as contributor
------------------------------------------------

Not only site managers are allowed to add Publication content items, but
also site contributors.

Let's logout and then login as 'contributor', a portal member that has the
contributor role assigned.

    >>> browser.getLink('Log out').click()
    >>> browser.open(portal_url)
    >>> browser.getControl(name='__ac_name').value = 'contributor'
    >>> browser.getControl(name='__ac_password').value = default_password
    >>> browser.getControl(name='submit').click()
    >>> browser.open(portal_url)

We use the 'Add new' menu to add a new content item.

    >>> browser.getLink('Add new').click()

We select 'Publication' and click the 'Add' button to get to the add form.

    >>> browser.getControl('Publication').click()
    >>> browser.getControl(name='form.button.Add').click()
    >>> 'Publication' in browser.contents
    True

Now we fill the form and submit it.

    >>> browser.getControl(name='title').value = 'Publication Sample'
    >>> browser.getControl('Save').click()
    >>> 'Changes saved' in browser.contents
    True

Done! We added a new Publication content item logged in as contributor.

Finally, let's login back as manager.

    >>> browser.getLink('Log out').click()
    >>> browser.open(portal_url)
    >>> browser.getControl(name='__ac_name').value = portal_owner
    >>> browser.getControl(name='__ac_password').value = default_password
    >>> browser.getControl(name='submit').click()
    >>> browser.open(portal_url)

    >>> browser.getControl(name='title').value = 'Boardfile Sample'
    >>> browser.getControl('Save').click()
    >>> 'Changes saved' in browser.contents
