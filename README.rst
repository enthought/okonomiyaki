Okonomiyaki is an experimental library aimed at consolidating a lot of our
low-level code used for Enthought's eggs.

The library contains code for the following:

        - producing EDM and enpkg-compatible egg from a tree + metadata
        - object models for eggs metadata, as well as versions and platform
          representations

It works on both python 2 and 3, and pypy. It is expected to work on pretty
much any compliant python implementation.
