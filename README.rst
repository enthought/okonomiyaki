Okonomiyaki is an experimental, private library aimed at consolidating a lot of
our low-level code used for Enthought's eggs.

The library contains code for the following:

        - producing enpkg-compatible egg from a tree + metadata
        - traitlets-based models for eggs metadata, as well as our legacy
          metadata
